1. 30
2. 10
3. 200,000/sample
4. MetaPhlAn version 2.1.0 (28 April 2015)
5. s__Neisseria_unclassified	7.76249

9. metaphlan_out
10. Yes, there is separation between the tongue samples and the plaque samples but there appears to be no separation between subgingival and supragingival. The separation occurs along PC1.
