We have constructed a Linux (Ubuntu v15.10 Desktop) Virtual Box Image that can be used to run the Microbiome Helper pipeline, which can be [downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5jyy5hyo0tre08/MicrobiomeHelper_v0.1.8.tar.gz?dl=0) (9.1 GB - compressed folder). See the README that will be downloaded for information on how to install on Windows, Mac or Linux.

The current latest version is v0.1.8. Note that this image is **still experimental** and will continually be updated.

Please email gavin[dot]douglas[at]dal[dot]ca if you have any questions or issues!
