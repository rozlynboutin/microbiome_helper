We have constructed a Linux (Ubuntu v15.10 Desktop) Virtual Box Image that can be used to run the Microbiome Helper pipeline, which can be [downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5jyy5hyo0tre08/MicrobiomeHelper_v0.1.8.tar.gz?dl=0).

This image is still under construction and will continually be updated.

Please email gavin[dot]douglas[at]dal[dot]ca if you have any questions or issues!
