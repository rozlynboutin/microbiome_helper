We have constructed a Linux (Ubuntu v15.10 Desktop) Virtual Box image that can be used to run the Microbiome Helper pipeline, which can be [downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ltbeoe29c9au8bm/MicrobiomeHelper_v0.2.0.tar.gz?dl=1) (9.6 GB - compressed folder). See the README contained with the download for information on how to install on Windows, Mac or Linux.

The current latest version is v0.2.0. Note that this image is **still experimental** and will continually be updated.

Note that this image requires installation of VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). For Mac users, the current version of VirtualBox should be installed for OSX 10.8 and higher, whereas those using earlier iterations should download VirtualBox Version 4.3. If you are using an older OS X and receive an error message when trying to run the Microbiome Helper shell using the current version of Vagrant, you may need to install an older version (sub-1.8.0).
