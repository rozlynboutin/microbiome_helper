We have constructed a Linux (Ubuntu v15.10 Desktop) Virtual Box image that can be used to run the Microbiome Helper pipeline. The latest version (v0.2.1.1) can be [downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0agn92j8xkq6hk/MicrobiomeHelper_v2.1.1.ova?dl=1) (11.7 GB - OVA file). This OVA file requires VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to install and will take up ~22 GB of disk space when installed.

You can [follow the instructions here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/import-export-ova-files-in-virtualbox) for how to install OVA files in VirtualBox.

If you get a "VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration" error when booting for the first time, you might be able to fix it by [following the steps here](http://www.itworld.com/article/2981515/virtualization/virtualbox-diagnose-and-fix-vt-xamd-v-hardware-acceleration-errors.html).

On older computers it's possible that you wont be able to run a 64-bit virtual machine. If you're hoping to use this virtual box for a tutorial it might be better to run through the tutorial before or after the session on a different computer.
