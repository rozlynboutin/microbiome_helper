We have packaged two tools with the Microbiome Helper VBox that can link OTUs with phenotype-based functions: [BugBase](https://bugbase.cs.umn.edu/index.html) and [FAPROTAX](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/louca/FAPROTAX/lib/php/index.php?section=Home) If you are interested in predicting gene-based functions then you should check out the PICRUSt [workflow](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki/PICRUSt-workflow) and/or [tutorial](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki/PICRUSt-tutorial) we have written.
