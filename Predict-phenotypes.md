There are several tools available to link OTUs with phenotype-based functions, two of which we have packaged with the Microbiome Helper VBox. If you are interested in predicting gene-based functions then you should check out the PICRUSt [workflow](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki/PICRUSt-workflow) and/or [tutorial](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki/PICRUSt-tutorial) we have written.
