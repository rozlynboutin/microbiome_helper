Microbiome Helper is a repository that contains several resources to help researchers working with microbial sequencing data: 
* A series of scripts that help process and automate various microbiome and metagenomic bioinformatic tools. 
* Workflows or standard operating procedures (SOPs) for analyzing 16S/18S rRNA and metagenomic data. 
* Tutorials with test data, example output, and questions for different microbiome analyses.
* A Virtual Box image that can be used to run our workflows and tutorials with little or no configuration.

These scripts were produced by the [Integrated Microbiome Resource](http://cgeb-imr.ca/index.html). It is important that you [cite](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki/Requirements) the tools that are wrapped by our [scripts](https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper).

**Note that the scripts and workflows are continually being updated.**
